# Everyone is Authorized Client

This project contains a class representing a client-side service component that always authorizes a credit card
purchase if the card number is valid.
The point is to have a deterministic external dependency for unit testing, but one that mucks up a production
project because cards are always authorized.
That provides an excuse to want to go back to the related BankOfRandomCreditAuthorizer class in a demo or lab.
